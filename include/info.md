This application allows you to explore raw unweigthed vaccination data from the [2014 Child National Immunization Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nis/data_files.htm).

It provides a **rough overview** to help analysts select indicators for further analysis elsewhere.

**User Guide**

- To select an idicator, click on its row on the table.
- Click on "Ctabs" to view cross-tabulation tables and plots
- Click on "Summary" to view summary stats
- Click on "XTable" to view grouped stats
- Click on "4Plot" to view grouped plot on first 4 discrete variables

This application was built **exclusively** as an exercise to learn R and Shiny without any communication with those formally studying the immunization survey data.
