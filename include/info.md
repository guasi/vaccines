This application was built **exclusively** as an exercise to learn R and Shiny. It was inspired by a desire to quickly obtain a rough overview of data that contain a large number of variables.

Currently you can explore raw unweighted vaccination data from the [2014 Child National Immunization Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nis/data_files.htm). In the future you will be able to upload your own dataset.

**User Guide**

- To select an indicator, click on its row on the table.
- Click on "Ctabs" to view contingency tables and plots
- Click on "Summary" to view summary statistics
- Click on "Plots" to view individual mini plots
- Click on "4Facets" to view grouped plot on first 4 discrete variables
