This Shiny application offers a way to explore raw data from the [National Immunization Surveyâ€”Child 2014](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nis/data_files.htm). It provides a **quick and rough overview** of all available variables to aid the selection process.

It was built exclusively as an exercise to learn R and Shiny without any communication with those formally studying the immunization survey data.
